## Description

This project is a portfolio website created using React that showcases my web development projects and skills. The website features a header, a section for content, and a footer. The header includes my name and a navigation menu with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio. The navigation titles include About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted. Clicking on a navigation title displays the corresponding section without reloading the page. The website is designed using a mobile-first approach and a color palette that distinguishes it from default Bootstrap themes and unstyled HTML sites.
